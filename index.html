                            Government of Independent India (Azad Hind) and transferred its headquarter at Rangoon on January
                            7, 1944. On the 5th April, 1944, the "Azad Hind Bank" was inaugurated at Rangoon. It was on this
                            occasion that Netaji used this chair for the first time. Later the chair was kept at the residence
                            of Netaji at 51, University Avenue, Rangoon, where the office of the Azad Hind Government was
                            also housed. Afterwards,at the time of leaving Burma, the Britishers handed over the chair to
                            the family of Mr.A.T.Ahuja, the well known business man of Rangoon. The chair was officially
                            handed over to the Government of India in January 1979. It was brought to Calcutta on the 17th
